Extracting text from images and PDFs using computer vision (CV) and Pytesseract involves leveraging CV techniques to preprocess the images or PDF pages, and then utilizing the Pytesseract library to perform optical character recognition (OCR) to extract the text. Here's a step-by-step description of the process:

Image Preprocessing: If you are working with images, you may need to preprocess them to enhance the text extraction results. This can involve techniques such as resizing the image, adjusting the contrast and brightness, removing noise, and applying image thresholding to convert the image to binary format.

PDF Processing: If you are working with PDF files, you'll need to convert each page of the PDF into an image format (such as JPEG or PNG) using libraries like PyPDF2 or pdf2image. This allows you to apply image-based processing techniques.

Text Extraction using Pytesseract: Once you have preprocessed the images or converted the PDF pages into images, you can use the Pytesseract library to perform OCR and extract the text. Pytesseract is a Python wrapper for Google's Tesseract OCR engine, which is widely used for text extraction from images.

Installing and Setting Up Pytesseract: Begin by installing Pytesseract and its dependencies. You will also need to download the language data files required for OCR, which can be done through the Pytesseract library or manually from the Tesseract GitHub repository.

Text Extraction Code: Write Python code that utilizes Pytesseract to extract text from the preprocessed images. You can use the pytesseract.image_to_string() function to extract the text from the image or image file. Customize the function parameters based on your specific requirements, such as specifying the language or applying additional image processing options.

Post-processing and Analysis: Once the text is extracted, you may need to perform post-processing steps on the extracted text to clean it up, remove unnecessary characters or symbols, and format it for further analysis or storage
